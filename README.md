# hello-world
Hi there

I am a developer who has been working on various projects using various programming languages,
I am well versed in a number of them and I am still learning cause in this field of ours, you only stop when your dead!

Programming is something I am very passionate about and have loved ever since I heard the word and what programmers do.
I can code using the following languages, java, php, javascript, html nd 5, c#, vb and a little c and c++. and also css if it counts.

I also have basic understanding of jquery although I haven't attemted writing my own.
